This plugin implements Servebolt's WordPress best practices, and connects your site to the Servebolt Control Panel.

== Description ==

The Servebolt Optimizer plugin adds functionality to implement Servebolt's best practices for WordPress. This includes database optimizations, errorlog review, automatic cache purging, automatic image optimization and resizing, performance recommendations, and support for down stream HTML caching.

Specifically, Servebolt Optimizer does two things for your site:

1. It connects your [WordPress hosted](https://servebo.lt/e3ke3) or [WooCommerce hosted](https://servebo.lt/724lz) Servebolt site to your [Servebolt Control Panel](https://servebo.lt/pf3hu).
2. Its features implement Servebolt's best practices for performance. These best practizes include database optimizations, error log review, automatic cache purging, automatic image optimization/resizing, performance recommendations and support for down stream HTML caching.

This project is maintained on [Github](https://servebo.lt/sog).

### Features

Read more about the plugin and all its features in our [Help Center](https://servebo.lt/servebolt-optimize-documentation).

### Accelerated Domains

The integration with our revolutionairy add-on performance and security enhancing service [Accelerated Domains](https://servebo.lt/4c9dw) is made possible by Servebolt Optimizer. Installing the Servebolt Optimizer will provide the required HTTP headers to make use of Accelerated Domains.

### Automatic purge of Cloudflare cache
Servebolt Optimizer supports the most complete solution for Cloudflare cache purging. The HTML Cache is automatically purged when any post type or term has been updated. You can also purge directly from the admin bar. This Cloudflare integration supports both the use of API key and API token authentication when communicating with the Cloudflare API.

### HTML Caching
This plugin rewrites HTTP headers of HTML to allow for HTML Caching, and for the browser to cache HTML. HTML Caching may introduce all sorts of problems for end users, so installation and testing should be performed by a professional.

### Configuration

This plugin can be controlled via the WordPress Dashboard or WP CLI. Additionally there are various filters and PHP constants at your disposal.

### Filter and constant reference

The plugin has various filters and PHP constants that allows third-party developers to alter the behaviour of the plugin. Please read the article [Filters and PHP constants](https://servebo.lt/servebolt-optimizer-filters-and-php-constants) in our help center to learn more.

### Testing

We test against the current production version of WordPress and the next beta/development version

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will Servebolt Optimizer plugin make my site faster? =

The Servebolt Optimizer plugin is primarily designed to make best use of our [WordPress hosting](https://servebo.lt/e3ke3) or [WooCommerce hosting](https://servebo.lt/724lz). Its database optimizing feature does indeed help in making your database faster and thus your site.

= Can I install this plugin if I'm not a Servebolt client? =

Yes, you can. The database optimizations are beneficial for everyone as well as the Cloudflare cache purge options. You would miss out on the [fastest WordPress hosting out there](https://servebo.lt/5xbqg), but you can use it on a non-Servebolt site.

= What if I discover a bug? =

If you're a Servebolt client, please reach out to our Support Team and we'll be happy to help you out there. Alternatively, you can create a support forum request [here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/servebolt-optimizer/).

= 3.5.4 =
* Bugfix - Removed menu manifest file option from Prefetch-feature. Due to some difficulties with making the menu manifest file work in the Prefetch-feature it was decided to remove it until further notice. The script and style file manifest files will persist as before.
* Bugfix - Resolved issue with the cache purge features in row actions for taxonomies/post types. The plugin adds purge cache-link in the row actions for posts and terms. We previously targeted all registered post types and taxonomies, but this is now changed to only target public post types and terms. The targeted post types and terms can also be controlled through filters (sb_optimizer_cache_purge_row_action_post_types, sb_optimizer_cache_purge_row_action_post_types_query, sb_optimizer_cache_purge_row_action_taxonomies, sb_optimizer_cache_purge_row_action_taxonomies_query).
* Bugfix - Automatic cache purge of products during WooCommerce checkout. In some cases there was an error during the WooCommerce checkout. The feature in question purged cache for the product during checkout so that stock amount and status would be kept up to date. This error should now be resolved.
* Bugfix - Automatic setup of WP Cron on multisite failed. The feature that sets the WP Cron up with the UNIX cron failed when ran on a multisite. This should now be fixed. The cause of the error was that the lockfiles we’re not generated with a valid filename. These lockfiles (originating from “flock”) keeps the system from running concurrent cron tasks, so that we force the system to wait until the previous job is done. Note that this is a Servebolt hosted only feature.
* Bugfix - Error during plugin uninstallation. There was an error during plugin uninstallation due to a missing PHP constant. This is now fixed.
* Bugfix - Errors when environment file is not present. There was some error related to the environment file not being found, either because there is a custom WordPress folder structure or because the file is removed (either by deletion on disk or by disabling the file in the control panel). The plugin now handles the absence of this file in a better way - the error handling was improved and there is an admin notice telling the user that the file is missing + instructions on how to fix this.

= 3.5.3 =
* Fixed incompatibility issue with plugin Lightweight Sidebar Manager
* Fixed issue with automatic cron setup (Servebolt-clients only) not working due to bug in the Servebolt API
* Added migration to clean up legacy transients (orphaned transients without expiry)
* Fixed bug in settings form for the Prefetch-feature
* Fixed bug in feature access check for the Accelerated Domains Image Resize-feature
* Fixed bug in database migration runner

= 3.5.2 =
* Fixed issue with cache headers and authentication-check (user role determination)

= 3.5.1 =
* Fixed issue with transient rows not expiring for the menu optimizer feature.

= 3.5 =
* Added support for cache provider "Servebolt CDN"
* Bugfix - WP Admin markup error. The styling for the information panel used in for example the cache settings page was broken in WordPress v5.9, but this is now fixed.
* New feature - Clear site data on login. In v3.5 a new feature was added - every time a user logs in then we return a header telling the browser to clear local storage and browser cache. This is useful to ensure that cached content gets cleared for logged in users.
* New feature - Support for Servebolt CDN. The plugin now supports Servebolt CDN.
* Beta feature - Accelerated Domains Prefetching. We’ve added a new feature for users of Accelerated Domains - Prefetching of assets and menu items. This feature allows for our infrastructure to preliminary fetch the assets of a webpage and cache them in our infrastructure which results in reduction of load time. Another feature is that menu items gets prefetched as well, meaning that when you navigate to a subpage it has already been cached and is ready to be served in no time!
* New feature - Cache purging when Accelerated Domains is disabled
We have added a feature to purge all cache even when Accelerated Domains is disabled. This is useful when deactivating Accelerated Domains and doing a proper “cleaning up” by clearing all cache.
* New feature - Automatic WP Cron setup (including Action Scheduler) (Servebolt-clients only). We have added a feature to automatically set up the WP Cron so that it runs using the UNIX cron. This offloads WordPress from having to trigger scheduled tasks as well as making the process of setting it up a lot easier. Note that this feature also sets up the Action Scheduler (used by WooCommerce and other plugins) to be run using the UNIX cron.
* Bugfix - Accelerated Domains Image Resize can only be enabled when site has access
Previously a Servebolt-client was able to enable Accelerated Domains Image Resizing even when the client did not have access to it (based on their subscription). We’ve not added a check so only eligible clients can enable the feature. Note that enabling the feature while not having access to it will result in the feature not being active. The subscription needs to be in place for the feature to work. This “bugfix” only fixes the GUI so that we communicate better to the client whether they have access or not.
* Bugfix - Improved cache purge queue feature
We’ve improved the cleanup of the cache purge queue to prevent the queu from growing too big. This is done by removing all completed queue items as well as removing failed queue items that are older than 1 month.
* New feature - Purge all network feature
We’ve now added a feature to purge all cache for all sites in a multisite-network. You can find it in the dropdown in the top bar in WP Admin.
* Bugfix - WooCommerce product simple cache purge on checkout
Whenever a user checks out in WooCommerce then the cache for the products in the cart will be purged. Due to how we purge cache a whole range of URLs might be included in the cache purging. This is because a post/page/product might be visible on the front page, in archives etc. and thus we include the front page URL, archive URL in the cache purge actions. But in the context of WooCommerce checkout and WooCommerce product we decided that a simple cache purge will suffice - this meaning that we only purge cache for the product URL, not the front page URL or any other related URL.
* Bugfix - WooCommerce product immediate cache purge on checkout. Whenever a user checks out in WooCommerce then the cache for the products in the cart will be purged. For many users this means using the queue to purge the cache of these products, but in the case of WooCommerce checkouts we now purge cache immediately regardless of whether they have the queue based cache purge active or not.
* Bugfix in Menu optimizer – We saw that the menu optimizer feature was incompatible with some WordPress-themes. The feature was therefore refactored and should now be better suited to work with most WordPress-themes.
